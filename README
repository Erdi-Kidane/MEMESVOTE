Fundation project: MEMES
This program was created to once and for all settle the debate raging over whether water is wet or not.
It accomplishes this by providing an "unbais" and "fair" voting tool you will be amazed at how easy a "No 
water is not wet" vote is for example.

Please find the executable in WindowsFormApp1/WindowsFormsApp1/bin/Debug/ the file is called MEMES.exe 
Once again since the goal is to make voting easy MEMES stands for the
Making Everything Mostly Effortless System.

Designed and built by a team of one and with a combined experience in C# programming of a couple of days.
